A student named ${session.user?.name} has requested a study plan. 
Their current state:
- Stress Level: ${stress}%
- Confidence Level: ${confidence}%
- Available Study Time: ${hours} hours

Generate a highly personalized, Markdown-formatted study schedule that includes:
1. **Mental State Acknowledgment**: A short, highly empathetic 2-sentence greeting acknowledging their exact stress and confidence levels. 
2. **Strategic Focus**: Based directly on their confidence (${confidence}%), give 1 short paragraph of advice on *how* they should study right now (e.g., if low confidence, focus on core concepts. If high, advance to hard practice problems). 
3. **Structured Time Blocks**: A mathematically divided schedule for the next ${hours} hours. Use Pomodoro or Deep Work blocks depending on what is most suitable for their stress.
4. **Wellness Checkpoints**: Because their stress is at ${stress}%, explicitly tell them to take specific breaks. If stress > 60%, mandate specific relaxation exercises (like 'Deep Breathing' or 'Guided Meditation') during their breaks.

Keep the output clean, highly actionable, structured with markdown headings and bold text, and encouraging.`;
